    <h1>Todo List Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Adding new entries:</h2>
    <p>
        To add an entry, type your task into the textbox and either press the enter key or the add button.</br>
        Your entry will appear in the task list on the left. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Using lists:</h2>
    <p>
        Once your entry is in the task list, you have the option of moving it to Today's tasks by dragging and dropping or saving the whole task list to a .txt file. 
        </br></br>
        Tasks in Today's tasks list will not be saved by the save feature, so it is up to the user to drag it back into the task list to save it if not completed.
        By pressing the enter key on the selected task in Today's tasks, it will be marked as completed, its text colour will turn red, displayed text " - finished" 
        will be appended to the task name and a strikethrough will be applied to it.
        If it has been marked completed accidentally, press the enter key again to unmark it. 
        </br></br>
        Be aware that these changes, except the appended " - finished" text, will not be visible while the selection focus is active on the selected task.        
    </p>

    <h2>Deleting tasks:</h2>
    <p>
        There are 2 buttons for handling the deletion of tasks. The "Clear All" button will remove all elements from both lists while the "Clear Completed"
        button will only remove items that have been marked as completed from Today's tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Saving and loading: </h2>
    <p>
        The save feature is located on the menubar under "File". Clicking on it will trigger the save function, which will save all tasks currently in the
        left Task list. Keep in mind that this save function will overwrite whatever tasks were saved in the previous session.
        </br></br>
        The load button is located next to the Add button, and will load all the tasks which have been saved as a result of the save function into the currently
        Task list, on top of whatever tasks have already been added.
    </p>
